OSARO, a San Francisco-based company focused on AI for industrial automation. They are building technology for the factories, warehouses, and logistics systems of the 21st century. They were founded to build technology and products that make robots smarter. Not only do they lead their peers in practical revenue-generating applications, they also have released 2 products, have deployments on 4 continents, and have relationships with several major global automation suppliers and integrators. As the currently brittle global supply chain is besieged by pandemic, fires, and climate change, e-commerce is exploding and so is the demand for their products. Their customers are investing in smart robotics automation to improve productivity now, to build operational resilience against future shocks, and to create a better and safer workplace for the 21st century.
