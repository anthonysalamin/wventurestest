Gordian Biotechnology is a therapeutics company focused on diseases of aging, the major unmet medical need of our generation. Age-related diseases have complex causes that include interactions with the aged environment, and traditional ex vivo screening methods have failed to produce effective treatments.To address this problem, Gordian’s platform combines gene therapy with single-cell sequencing to test hundreds of therapies in individual animals, the only model that captures the full complexity of age-related disease.We thus scale in vivo efficacy testing to cover every therapeutic target at the very beginning of the drug discovery process. This lets us choose targets that really impact disease biology, to develop and commercialize therapies for the world’s deadliest diseases, and eventually for the processes of aging itself.
